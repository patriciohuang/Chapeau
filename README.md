# Chapeau - Restaurant Ordering System

> A staff-facing application to manage customer orders, providing efficient Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations and real-time status visibility.

Chapeau is a core system designed for restaurant staff, including servers and kitchen personnel, to streamline the order management process. It was developed as a group project and forked from the original [Jeroen-vd-Valk/Chapeau](https://github.com/Jeroen-vd-Valk/Chapeau) repository.
